# Claude Code Subagents

## Git Workflow Manager Subagent

Simple agent for managing git commits. This agent will validate any security concers, craft commit messages based on the work done and commit said changes to the projects remote repo. 

### Requirements

If you want autonomous commits, you need to set up ssh keys and allow the agent access to the repo.

### Addons

I also give these directions to the agent to ensure that I can execute "push code" without interruption and there are no unnecessary claude code attributes added to the commit messages.
